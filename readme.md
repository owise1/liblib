# Lib Lib

Lib Lib is a "media" server built on [couchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/). "Media" is in quotes because the term is being used as loosely as possible (traditional digital items like books, music, video, as well as photos, digital artwork, event archives... really any digital "stuff" you want to keep).
